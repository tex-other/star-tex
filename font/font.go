// Face is a font face. Its glyphs are often derived from a font file, such as
// "cmr10.pfb", but a face has a specific size, style, weight and
// hinting. For example, the 12pt and 18pt versions of Computer Modern are two
// different faces, even if derived from the same font file.
//
// A Face is not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines, as its methods
// may re-use implementation-specific caches and mask image buffers.
//
// To create a Face, look to other packages that implement specific font file
// formats.
