// Face is a font face. Its glyphs are often derived from a font file, such as
// "cmr10.pfb", but a face has a specific size, style, weight and
// hinting. For example, the 12pt and 18pt versions of Computer Modern are two
// different faces, even if derived from the same font file.
//
// A Face is not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines, as its methods
// may re-use implementation-specific caches and mask image buffers.
//
// To create a Face, look to other packages that implement specific font file
// formats.

	// advance width.
	//
	// It returns !ok if the face does not contain a glyph for r.
	//
	// The contents of the mask image returned by one Glyph call may change
	// after the next Glyph call. Callers that want to cache the mask must make
	// a copy.
